## 📝 Assignment Overview

This assignment explores the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to a high-dimensional categorical dataset (Mushroom classification). The task is to reduce dimensionality after one-hot encoding and evaluate the effect of this reduction on a **Logistic Regression classifier**.  

Key objectives:  
1. Apply one-hot encoding and standardization to categorical features.  
2. Perform PCA and analyze variance distribution via scree plot.  
3. Visualize data in reduced dimensions to assess class separability.  
4. Compare baseline Logistic Regression performance with PCA-transformed performance.  
5. Reflect on trade-offs between dimensionality reduction, information retention, and model efficiency.
